East Coast fever or theileriosis is an animal disease in Africa caused by the protozoan parasite Theileria parva. It does not include tropical theileriosis (or Mediterranean theileriosis), a cattle disease caused by T. annulata, nor human theileriosis, caused by T. microti.

As of 1992 East Coast fever was called probably the most important livestock disease of cattle, sheep and goats in Africa, causing an annual loss of 1.1 million cattle and $168 million in 1992.
